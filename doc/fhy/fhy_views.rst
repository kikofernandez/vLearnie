FHY Views
===========

.. _fhy_views:

Here you can see the views which forms the FHY application. We have divided the views into two, so we have the :ref:`views for the admin <fhy_views_admin>` and the :ref:`views for the forms <fhy_views_forms>`


Views:
-------
This kind of views were thought for showing content and providing editing options. For instance, you will find functions like :func:`show_root_directory <fhy.views.admin.show_root_directory>`. These views are the following ones:

.. _fhy_views_admin:

.. automodule:: fhy.views.admin
   :members:

.. _fhy_views_forms:

Forms:
-------
These views are those that use a form. It doesn't matter whether they use it for creating, editing or deleting an object. These views are the following ones:

.. automodule:: fhy.views.forms
   :members:
